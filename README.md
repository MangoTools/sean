:exclamation: This project is on early stage. It is still not functional. Please come back in a week!

SEAN is an opinionated fullstack javascript framework based on SQL (sequelize Express Angular and Node).

This project  found it's root on [MEANJS](http://meanjs.org) project.

This is a great tool that we love to use, but as we need a relational database for some of our projects, we decided to make our own fork using Sequelize instead of mongo-db.
